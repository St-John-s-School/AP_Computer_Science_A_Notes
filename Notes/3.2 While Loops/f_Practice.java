    Working with a partner on a whiteboard, write some programs that use while loops!

    Problem 1:
    Write a program that determines the 4th instance of "a" in a String s. 
    You may assume that the String s is really long and has at least 4 a's. 

    Problem 2: 
    Write a program that continually prompts the user for Strings
    as long as they're longer than the previous String. 
    As a hint, your while loop should look like it will go on forever...
