    We are now going to look at the second
    kind of loop in Java. 

    They are called "while" loops, and we
    saw one in the Tic-Tac-Toe Project.

    This is what every while loop looks like:
        
    while (<test>)
    {
    *body*
    }

    Notice that while loops look like if statements.
    We have:

    1) A logical test that is either true or false

    and

    2) code that runs if the test is true

    The only difference is that now, after the code runs
    we go back to the test, check it again, and repeat. 

    Consider the following two examples. What will they do?
    */

    // int number = 1;
    // while (number < 100)
    // {
    //   System.out.println(number);
    //   number++;
    // }

    /*
    Q: What is the LAST value printed by the above loop?
    */

    // String s = "hello";
    // while (s.length() > 0)
    // {
    //     System.out.println(s.charAt(0));
    //     s = s.substring(1);
    // }

    /*
    Q: What does this loop do each time it iterates? 
    
    Q: What will s be equal to after the loop ends? 
    */
    }

}
