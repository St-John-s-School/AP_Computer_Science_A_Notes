    It turns out that we can really do the same
    thing with both for and while loops.

    The code on the previous file gave an example
    of when while loops are better. 

    A good rule of thumb (heuristic) is that
    you should use while loops when neither you
    nor your computer know how many times the loop should run. 

    Consider the for loop below.
    Write a while loop that does the same thing.

    // {
    //     prod *= a;

  Q: In a for loop, the "loop variable" is made for us 
     AND incremented for us.
     In a while loop, where do we make it? 
     Where do we increment it?
