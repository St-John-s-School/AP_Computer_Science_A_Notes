    Working with a partner on a whiteboard, write some programs that use ArrayLists

    Problem 0:
    We will do Problem 0 as a class
    Using a loop, generate an ArrayList of the first ten odd integers,
    then print it out.

    Problem 1:
    Make an ArrayList of Strings containing the names of the people you
    are working with. 
    Then, using a loop, remove all the names from the ArrayList.

    Problem 2:
    Make an ArrayList of 20 random integers between 0 and 10,
    then calculate the average of that ArrayList. 









    HINT: int a = (int) Math.random() * 11;
