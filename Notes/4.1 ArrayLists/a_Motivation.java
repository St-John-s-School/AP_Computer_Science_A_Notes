    Welcome back! Whoever wrote these notes hopes you had a great winter break.

    One of the final things discussed last semester was the array, which we learned
    is a big list of variables or objects. Arrays had length, indices, and elements.

    We found that they're pretty useful! However, consider the following scenarios:

    1) You have two Arrays of Student Objects representing the JV and Varsity Golf rosters.
       You decide to promote a student from the JV roster to Varsity.

       Can you do this with Arrays? Can Arrays change in length?

    2) You have an Array of students representing the students in an AP CS class. However,
       the student in index 3 has decided to drop the class. How can you represent this
       with an Array? Is it easy?

    These two conundrums illustrate the need for *another* kind of data structure.
