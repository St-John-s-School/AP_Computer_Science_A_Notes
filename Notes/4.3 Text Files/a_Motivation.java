    We've gotten better at working with data, 
    but, so far, all of our data has ended when the program
    has ended. Similarly, we've needed to input the 
    data we've wanted to use in our program.

    This might be kind of tedious if we want to build bigger programs. 
    
    Consider these scenarios:
    
    1) You have a list of 180 student names and grades that you need to process.
       You could type them all into an array in your code, but that would take
       forever, and perhaps defeat the purpose of writing a program.
    
    2) You want to program Wordle, and so you need a big list of words
       which you will use as a database. Once again, you don't want to 
       type them all in with Scanner. 

    Idea: There is a lot of data already on out there already.
    If we can get our programs to read it directly, we can turn it
    into an array or ArrayList very easily.
