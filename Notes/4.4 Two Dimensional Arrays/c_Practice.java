    We will do Problem 0 as a class:

    Problem 0:
    Can you make a 10 by 10 array of the first 100 numbers?

    Problem 1: 
    Can you make an ArrayList of Strings representing your interpretation
    of how your Carrier normally sits (a seating chart)?

    HINT: You can make individual Arrays of Strings, then combine them into a 2D array.
    String[][] chart = {array1, array2, array3, etc};
