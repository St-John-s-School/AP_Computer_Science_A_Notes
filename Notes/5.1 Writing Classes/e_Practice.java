    Q: What methods should we have? 

    Problem 1: (partner, whiteboard, yadda yadda)

    Write the TrafficLight class.

    A TrafficLight object will have one variable (color)

    There will be a constructor, and two other methods

    -void advance(). This will advance the traffic light to the next color.
    -boolean isSafeToGo().
     This will return whether it's safe for cars to cross the traffic light.
