    Working with a partner on a whiteboard,
    write some programs!

    Problem 0:
    Write a program that:
    1) Asks the user for a number
    2) Determines if it is divisible by 10

    Problem 1:
    Write a program that:
    1) Asks the user for a String
    2) Determines if the String starts and ends
    with the same letter

    Problem 2:
    Write a program that:
    1) Asks the user to input "True" or "False"
    2) Casts that String input into the
       corresponding boolean value

    HINT: When do we want a boolean value of true?
