    Working with a partner on a whiteboard, write some programs that use ArrayLists

    Problem 0:
    Consider the ArrayList of Booleans called values.
    It's declaration looks something like this:
    ArrayList<Boolean> values = new ArrayList<>();
    values.add(true);
    values.add(false);
    ...
    values.add(true);

    Using a traditional for loop, count the number of "trues" in values.

    Then, using an enhanced for loop, count the number of "trues" in values.

    Problem 1: 
    Consider two ArrayLists of Strings called "one" and "two".
    Using two enhanced for loops,
    figure out how to merge the two ArrayLists into
    a third one, called "three".
