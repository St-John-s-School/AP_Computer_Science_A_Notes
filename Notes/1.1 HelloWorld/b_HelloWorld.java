/*
Your file name needs to be the same as whatever comes after
public class {file_name}

To print something, put it inside quotes ("") inside of a print command.
"print" is the first command (method) we will learn in Java.
In Java, print commands look like this:
System.out.println("");

The semicolon tells your computer that the line is over
Basically every line of code in Java ends in a semicolon.
