    Working with a partner on a whiteboard, write some programs that use while loops!

    Problem 0:
    Declare and initialize the following arrays:

    a) An array storing the names of the people you are working with. 
       Use the traditional construction for this (the one that uses "new")

    b) An array storing the carriers that are meeting on this day of the rotation.
       Ex: ["F", "E", "A", "G", "D"]
       Use the abbreviated construction for this (the one that uses {...})

    Problem 1: 
    Consider this array of integers int[] arr = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19};
    Write code to find and print the sum of all the elements of this array. 

    Problem 2:
    Consider a hypothetical, really long array of names like:
    String[] s = {"Allen", "Allen", "Bob", "Brad", "Brad", "Calvin", ...}
    You don't know how long this array is, but you want to know how many people have the same name as you.
    Write code that counts the number of people that have your name in the array!
